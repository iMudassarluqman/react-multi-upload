# react-file-upload
A simple library to preview delete multiple images with react
# How it Works:
so this library tracks the images with their unique id like when a user upload an image it converts images into base64 and also keep that same image in a state in formdata so it is easier to upload images in formdata without any converting

# How To Use:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
